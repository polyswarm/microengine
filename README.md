# Scratch

This project is a skeleton of a microengine. 

It cannot function due to a lack of an analysis backend, but it is capable of speaking to `polyswarmd`. 

When a file is bounty'ed, it simply prints an error that no analysis backend is available.

* scratch.go is a scratch microengine written in go. It has no analysis backend.

* scratch.py is a scratch microengine written in python. It has no analysis backend.
